## NFC Tag Operations

### Overview  

![Screenshot showing Overview before](https://github.com/nativeapptemplate/NativeAppTemplate-Free-Android/blob/main/docs/images/overview_before.png "Screenshot showing Overview before")

![Screenshot showing Overview after](https://github.com/nativeapptemplate/NativeAppTemplate-Free-Android/blob/main/docs/images/overview_after.png "Screenshot showing Overview after")

The app replaces traditional paper tags with NFC tags to efficiently manage walk-in customer waitlists. It writes application-specific information onto your NFC cards (referred to as :red_circle: **Server Tag** and :large_blue_circle: **Customer Tag**).

**For Customers:**  
When a customer scans a :large_blue_circle: **Customer Tag**, they can view the :green_circle: **Number Tags Webpage** (a public webpage) on their mobile browser. This page displays completed Number Tags.

**For Staff:**  
By scanning a :red_circle: **Server Tag** paired with the :large_blue_circle: **Customer Tag**, staff can complete a Number Tag. Completed Number Tags automatically appear on the :green_circle: **Number Tags Webpage** for customer reference.

### How It Works  

![Screenshot showing Write Application Info to Tag screen, Scan Tag screen, and Shop Detail screen](https://github.com/nativeapptemplate/NativeAppTemplate-Free-Android/blob/main/docs/images/screenshots_nfc.png "Screenshot showing Write Application Info to Tag screen, Scan Tag screen, and Shop Detail screen")

1. Write application info to pair **Number Tags** (Server Tag and Customer Tag) or a **Customer QR code**:  
   - Go to: **Shops > [Shop] > Shop Settings > Manage Number Tags > [Number Tag]**.  
2. Scan a **Server Tag** in the **Scan** tab.  
3. View the updated **Number Tags** status in the **Shop Detail** screen or on the **Number Tags Webpage** (see Background Tag Reading GIF below).  

### Recommended NFC Tags  
For best performance, use **NTAG215 (540 bytes)** tags.  
Example: [50pcs NFC Cards Ntag215](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087FRYY8S) (Amazon USA).

### Background Tag Reading  

![Gif showing Background Tag Reading](https://github.com/nativeapptemplate/NativeAppTemplate-Free-Android/blob/main/docs/images/nfc.gif "Showing Background Tag Reading")  

1. Scan a Server Tag.  
2. View the updated Number Tags status in the **Shop Detail** screen or on the **Number Tags Webpage**.  

The **Number Tags Webpage** updates in real-time using Rails [Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev).  
This functionality is available in:  
- [NativeAppTemplate-API (Solo)](https://nativeapptemplate.com/products/api-solo)  
- [NativeAppTemplate-API (Team)](https://nativeapptemplate.com/products/api-team)
